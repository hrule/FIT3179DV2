                With the start of the 25-26 NBA season around the corner, 
                lets take a quick review of on NBA transactions, and what we can

                The map on the right shows how teams involvement in trades have changed over time.
                It is commonly rumoured that teams avoid trading within their own conference, however 
                multiple analyses have found no evidence for this, and as we can see, trades seem frequent,
                and indiscriminatory. 
              </p>
              <p class="header-text">
                Each NBA season can be thought of as a fiscal year starting from July 1st, and ending June 30th. 
                So far, for the 2025 season, which is kicking off soon, 47 teams have been involved in trades.
                Typically around 100 teams are involved in trades per season, so we can expect to see more movement in the future.

                      Some notable observations you might be able to make are that the Spurs have had 
                      relatively little involvement in trades (38) in the past 15 seasons. This may be due to 
                      their nature to develop talent, as well as their dynasty from 1999 to 2014.

                a common trend both team salaries and their rankings over time. 
  
                With the salaries, you'll see that all teams are above the Salary Cap, which is intended to be a 
                maximum limit on the amount that teams are able to spend, to limit wealthier teams from constructing 
                unfair rosters. Some will even go above the Second Apron, which incurs heavy penalties.

                Even more interestingly, in the rankings chart, the success of teams are like unpredictable waves.
                For the Western conference, all top 5 ranking teams of last season showed a noticeable dip in rankings
                in the 2021 season. <br>
                This demonstrates that teams windows of high-level competition are limited. With salary, aging, and

                  Teams trade and make transactions in order to win. 
                  Taking a look back at some of the most impactful trades of last season, 
                  Jimmy Butler and Luka Doncic are some great examples. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Before the Warriors landed Jimmy Butler, they were 25W-26L (49% win rate).
                  <br>
                  However after the Jimmy Butler trade, they went 23W-8L (74% win rate) to finish the season. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Trades can alter the trajectory of a whole franchise. 
                  The Warriors after signing Jimmy Butler, signed Al Horford recently, and aim to make the Playoffs. 
                  <br>
                  The Lakers are also making big moves to surround Luka Doncic with sufficient talent.

                  Sometimes a single trade is the difference to winning a championship.

                  The Detroit Pistons have proved to make a large yet cheap single year leap, 
                  similar to the San Antonio Spurs. On the otherhand, other teams are 'tanking', and 
                  slimming down to prepare for future competition, such as the Nets.
